                        Damages – bodily injuries – loss of income and income earning capacity must be proved – where loss is established the court must use available evidence to determine quantum of loss – determination by trial court of quantum based on undisputed factual findings may not be set aside on appeal, unless the trial court is clearly wrong. Trial court clearly wrong in relying on salary scales that were not compatible with the evidence and failing to take into account the claimant’s age and pre-morbid career – post morbid contingencies increased to 35%. <br />

                        Criminal Procedure – before a witness testifies in a criminal trial in appropriate circumstances an inquiry must be held into whether he or she understands the nature and import of the oath or affirmation as provided in ss 162(1) and 163 of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 – where a witness is found not to understand the nature and import of the oath or affirmation due to intellectual incapacity an inquiry must be held in terms of s 164 of that Act into whether he or she understands the difference between truth and falsehood ─ failure of trial court to hold an inquiry into whether a mentally ill witness understands the difference between truth and falsehood renders the evidence of that witness inadmissible. <br />

                        Exception to plea – upholding an exception disposes of the pleading, not the action or defence – ordinarily therefore the court should grant leave to amend and not dispose of the matter – an excipient has a duty to persuade the court that upon every interpretation which the plea can bear no defence is disclosed - tacit agreement pleaded constitutes a termination of the written agreement, not a variation thereof.<br />
